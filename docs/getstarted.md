# Getting started

After downloading the launcher and opening it for the first time, you will be greeted with a sign-in screen. In order to use the launcher, you need to log in.

## Logging in
In order to log in, you need to pick an account type. Currently MojoLauncher supports the following account types:

1. Local account

Local accounts are the most basic account type. They allow you to sign in using only the username, and do not perform authentication against any kind of service. Use a local account if you just want to play the game and don't plan on joining any online mode servers.

2. Microsoft account

Mocrosoft accounts use the regular Minecraft authentication system. To successfully log in with a Microsoft account in MojoLauncher, you need to have Minecraft: Java Edition purchased on your Microsoft account, and a profile set up on https://minecraft.net

3. Ely.by account

Ely.by accounts use the third-party Ely.by authentication system. Use this account type if you can't use a Microsoft account and want to see skins or play on a server that uses the Ely.by authentication system.

After logging in with your chosen account type, you can proceed to the launcher's main menu
