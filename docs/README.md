# MojoLauncher
MojoLauncher is an application that launches Minecraft: Java Edition on your Android devices with additional convenience featues such as instance-based game data separation, easy installation of various mod loaders and modpacks, advanced (enough) on-screen controls and more.

2. Download from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/MojoLauncher/MojoLauncher/actions). This is where in-development versions are released. Github sign-in is required.
3. [Build it yourself from source](./developer/build.md)

MojoLauncher is currently **not** available on iOS devices. If you want this to change, you should [donate](https://boosty.to/artdeell/single-payment/donation/710722/target) so that I can buy a Mac and an iPhone for this.

After obtaining the app, you should learn how to [get started](./getstarted.md).
